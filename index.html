      <p>This project was based on my favorite movies. It was enjoyable to complete this project since I was able to include movie information as well as my own spoilers and related movies. I learned new CSS styles, which was an amazing experience.</p>

    <div class="project-2">

      <p>This was my first major game-making project. Because I struggled so much with how to link to a separate page, how to design the button, or how to add photos, I can say that I won't ever forget this project. The challenge was real, but once I finished it, I felt really proud.</p>

      <p>Using Python, I completed a project that was quite similar to my first game. The process of creating this game was challenging since I had to think out the principles. However, using the elif method was really simple, and I really liked how it turned out.</p>

      <p>In this JavaScript project, I used click, hide and the true and false statements. But because I find it to be so complicated, doing this was pretty difficult for me. I thought about giving up, but I continued, and the results were spectacular.</p>
